# Seederly - A smarter API tester

Seederly is a modern API tester, but smarter. 
It lets you create, test, and send HTTP requests while automatically generating realistic, structured, 
and schema-based fake data, with none of that AI bloat, powered by Bogus, built with speed and developer experience in mind.

## Features
- 🧪 Send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
- 🧬 Schema-based data generation using [Bogus](https://github.com/bchavez/Bogus)
- 🧠 Intelligent faker with nested object and array support
- 📝 JSON body templating using short and intuitive keys (`name.firstName`, `address.city`, etc.)

## Roadmap
- [ ] GUI (Avalonia-based)
- [ ] JSON schema visual editor
- [ ] Exportable and shareable workspaces
- [ ] API Test runner
