# Seederly - A smarter API tester

Seederly is a fast, modern API testing tool designed with simplicity, power, and developer experience in mind. Unlike bloated tools, Seederly focuses on providing you with everything you need to test APIs and generate realistic test data, all without unnecessary complexity.

## Features
- **Send HTTP Requests:** Easily test your APIs with GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other HTTP methods.
- **Schema-Based Data Generation:** Generate structured, realistic data based on your defined schemas using  [Bogus](https://github.com/bchavez/Bogus)
- **Workflow Runner:** Build and execute workflows to call multiple API endpoints in a chain. Supports value extraction and injection between requests, making it easy to chain requests with dynamic data.
